## Description

My first project using Nodejs, I explored building a application without a web browser to run my code. Instead, everything with this project is done in the terminal. Although, thankfully still in the javascript language written in visual studio code. When the user has all the nesscessary packages, they can simply run `node index.js` and follow along answering its prompts. These prompts are then used to populate a template and the end product is a formatted README.md file you can be proud of!

## Installation 

Inorder for this application to work you have to have the npm package inquirer downloaded.This is the package that allows for neat and tidy questions to be prompted in the terminal. Its installation and information can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4). As well as you need Nodejs which can be found [here2](https://nodejs.org/en). 



## Usage 
If all the installation portions are in order,and you are in the correct file, a simple  `node index.js` should be all you need to play. Then answer the prompts given.
